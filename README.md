# Sally Wardle, freelance journalist

This is the repository for Sally Wardle's portfolio site as a freelance journalist. It is deployed using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and she has edit access using [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/). The site is compiled using the static site generator [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/)

If it's of interest, I precompiled the CSS in Sass, which is not available in the repo. This could be an oversight. There is minimal Javascript, specifically to handle form validation (although again, form submission is handled by Netlify's native Form functionality and sent straight to Sally).

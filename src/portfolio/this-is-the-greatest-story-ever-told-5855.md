[Three wise men](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_Magi "Biblical Magi")([magi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magi "Magi")) follow a brightly shining star from Asia to[Jerusalem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem "Jerusalem")in search of a newborn king. They are summoned by King[Herod the Great](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herod_the_Great "Herod the Great"), whose advisers inform him of a[Messiah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messiah "Messiah")mentioned in various prophecies. When Herod remembers that the prophecy names nearby[Bethlehem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethlehem "Bethlehem")as the child's birthplace, he sends the Magi there to confirm the child's existence—and secretly sends guards to follow them and "keep \[him] informed." In Bethlehem, the Magi find a married couple—[Mary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary,_mother_of_Jesus "Mary, mother of Jesus")and[Joseph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Joseph "Saint Joseph")—laying their[newborn son in a manger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nativity_of_Jesus "Nativity of Jesus"). Mary states that his name is[Jesus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus "Jesus"). As[the local shepherds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annunciation_to_the_shepherds "Annunciation to the shepherds")watch, the Magi present gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh to the infant. After observing the distant spies' departure, the magi leave as an angel's voice warns Joseph to "take the child" and "flee".

The spies inform Herod, who decides to kill the child. He orders[the death of every newborn boy in Bethlehem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacre_of_the_Innocents "Massacre of the Innocents"), and dies shortly after being informed that apparently "not one is alive". However, Joseph and Mary have[escaped into Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_into_Egypt "Flight into Egypt")with Jesus; when a messenger informs them and others of Herod's death, they return to their hometown of[Nazareth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazareth "Nazareth").

A pro-Israel rebellion breaks out in Jerusalem against Herod's son,[Herod Antipas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herod_Antipas "Herod Antipas"), but the conflict is quickly quashed.[Herod's kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herodian_kingdom "Herodian kingdom")is divided,[Judea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judea_(Roman_province) "Judea (Roman province)")is placed under a governor, and Herod becomes of[tetrarch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herodian_Tetrarchy "Herodian Tetrarchy")of[Galilee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galilee "Galilee")and the[Jordan River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_River "Jordan River"). Both he and the Romans are convinced that the Messiah the troubled people cry for is "someone who will never come".

Many years later, a prophet named[John the Baptist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_the_Baptist "John the Baptist")appears and preaches at the Jordan, baptizing many who come to repent. When a grown Jesus appears to him, John[baptizes him](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptism_of_Jesus "Baptism of Jesus"). Jesus then ascends into the nearby desert mountains, where he finds a cave in which resides a mysterious[hermit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermit "Hermit")—a personification of[Satan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satan "Satan"). The Dark Hermit[tempts Jesus three times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temptation_of_Christ "Temptation of Christ"), but each temptation is overcome by Jesus, who leaves and continues climbing as John's message echoes in his mind.

He returns to the valley, where he tells the Baptist that he is returning to Galilee. Four men—[Judas Iscariot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judas_Iscariot "Judas Iscariot")and the Galilean fishermen[Andrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_the_Apostle "Andrew the Apostle"),[Peter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Peter "Saint Peter"), and[John](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_the_Apostle "John the Apostle")—ask to go with him; Jesus welcomes them, promising to make them "[fishers of men](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishers_of_men "Fishers of men")". When they rest under a bridge, he gives parables and other teachings, which attract the attention of a passing young man named[James](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_the_Less "James the Less"); he asks to join them the next morning, and Jesus welcomes him. The group comes near Jerusalem, and Jesus says that "there will come a time to enter". They rest at a home in[Bethany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethany "Bethany")occupied by[Lazarus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazarus_of_Bethany "Lazarus of Bethany")and his sisters[Martha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_of_Bethany "Martha of Bethany")and[Mary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_of_Bethany "Mary of Bethany"). Lazarus asks Jesus if he could join him, but cannot bring himself to leave all he has; before leaving, Jesus promises Lazarus that he will not forget him.

The group soon arrives at[Capernaum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capernaum "Capernaum"), where they meet James's brother[Matthew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_the_Apostle "Matthew the Apostle"), a tax collector whom Jesus soon asks to join them. After some thought, Matthew does so. In the local[synagogue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synagogue "Synagogue"), Jesus teaches again, and miraculously[helps a crippled man to walk again](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing_the_paralytic_at_Capernaum "Healing the paralytic at Capernaum"). Upon seeing this, many begin to follow Jesus on his journey and gather to listen to his teachings.

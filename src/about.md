Freelance journalist, based in London. 

I began my career at the Press Association, the UK's leading national news agency. I initially covered breaking news and current affairs, before later being appointed as Health and Science Correspondent. 

Most recently, I was Associate Health Editor at the Mail on Sunday, writing news stories and long-form features on everything from cancer care to Covid-19.

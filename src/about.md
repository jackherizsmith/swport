title: ABOUT ME
blurb: >-
  Over the past five years, I have built a reputation as a determined and
  reliable journalist. I have significant experience reporting on national news,
  and a proven track record of landing exclusives and generating original story
  ideas. 

  <br>

  I trained and spent the first four years of my career working at the Press Association, as both a general news reporter and health and science correspondent.

  I am now associate health editor at the Mail on Sunday.
